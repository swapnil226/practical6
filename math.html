    Following a tradition of dedication and excellence in this diverse subject, the department comprises of highly qualified academicians with specializations in various fields like analysis, algebra, operation research and cryptography. The students pursuing the course, B.Sc.(Hons) Mathematics offered by the department, can look forward for the development of their logical ability and analytic skills. The semester based syllabi provides a comprehensive survey of areas like analysis, algebra, mathematical modelling using differential equations, mathematical programming and statistics. A lot of emphasis is given to 'hands-on' exposure to modern software such as Mathematica, Matlab and LaTeX through practical. The Mathematics Society 'Pi' organizes seminars, quizzes, discussions and talks on regular basis for exploration beyond the prescribed syllabi. The students actively participate in other co-curricular activities in the College for their holistic development. Students graduating from the department have had a world of career options. A reasonable number go for masters in pure or applied mathematics to prepare themselves for research and teaching. Others have excelled in their chosen fields that include statistics, actuarial sciences, operation research, management, law, and the civil services.
